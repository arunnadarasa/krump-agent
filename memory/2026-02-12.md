# February 12, 2026 - Asura Krump Skill Creation

## Task Completed
- Created Asura Krump skill repository for use with Telegram bot
- Repository: https://github.com/arunnadarasa/asura-krump-skill
- Files created:
  1. SKILL.md - Comprehensive profile of Asura (Arun Nadarasa)
  2. README.md - Documentation for the skill
  3. KRUMP_HISTORY.md - Krump history and fundamentals as memory bank

## Asura Profile Summary
- Real Name: Arun Nadarasa
- Krump Name: Asura (also known as Ryuazuki)

- Background: Pharmacist with Judo black belt
- Organizations: Desi Buck, Gully Ranis, Krump Save Lives UK
- Achievements: Hillary International Award for Health & Care Leadership (2022)
- Philosophy: "Kindness Over Everything"

## Follow-up: Interactive Replies Enabled
- Added explicit binding for Telegram group -5109826946 to krump-agent
- Set requireMention: false so bot responds to any message
- Restarted gateway twice to apply config
- Verified bot is responding ( transcript shows reply to user query )
- Bot uses Step 3.5 Flash model for conversational replies
- Asura skill loaded into agent toolset

## Observed Behavior
- Bot replies to user messages in ~7 seconds
- Does not reply to its own outgoing messages (loop prevention)
- Response style is cautious and tool-aware; can be tuned to be moreKrump-centric if desired

## Next Steps
- Ask user to test by sending a fresh message like "Hello" or "What is Krump?"
- If no reply in 10s, verify bot membership and group permissions
- Consider adjusting system prompt for more consistent Asura persona in all answers
